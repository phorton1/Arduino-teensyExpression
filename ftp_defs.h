// NOTE INFO MESSAGES
//
//      Following most NoteOn and NoteOff messages is a B7 1E xy
//      "NoteInfo" message, where x is the string number and y is a
//      compressed 0..15 velocity value (for the VU meter).
//
//      Although these appear to be primarly used to drive the FTP editor
//      sensitivity VU meter, they also appear to be neded to drive the FTP
//      'fretboard' display, as there is no other apparent way for the editor
//      to know which string was meant in a NOTE_ON message.
//
//      In my system, the lifetime of the "Note" (note_t object) is
//      bracketed by the 1E messages, and NOT by the note on and note off messages.
//      I cache the NOTE_ON and NOTE_OFF values, as a pair of uint8_s.
//
//      Thus I assume that these 1E messages refer to the most recent
//      NoteOn or NoteOff message.   There is a notion of the "most_recent"
//      note object, which is the most recently created one, which
//      comes into play in the Tuning messages.
//
// TUNING MESSAGES:
//
//      Following the NoteOn/1E message is usually a single B7 1D yy
//      and a series of B7 3D yy messages.  These are generally tuning
//      messages, where yy is the 0x40 biased signed number (from -0x40
//      to 0x40).
//
//      I call the 1D message a "SetTuning" message as it appears to
//      set the tunning relative to the most recent NoteOn/Off message,
//      whereas the 3D messages appear to be continuations, which I just
//      call "Tuning" messages.   It is not invariant that a NoteOn or
//      NoteOff is followed by a 1D ... the tuner will keep working on
//      a given string if multiple strings are picked.
//
//      Therefore I grab the "most recent" note upon a 1D and asusme that
//      is the note we are tuning.  If it goes away, the tuner is turned
//      off until the next 1D in the context of a new NoteOn/1E message

// POLY (MONO) MODE via patch change
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
//  poly = all strings on channel 1
//  mono = each string on channel 1..6
//
//  DOES NOT REQUIRE BOOTING CONTROLLER WITH UP BUTTON PRESSED
//  which puts you in "hardware" mode.   The FTP accepts patch
//  and bank changes when booted normally.
//
//  When booted normally it comes up in hardware patch #1, which
//  is PolyProgram1, which has it's poly/mono bit set to "poly".
//
//  At this time the full first bank has that setting.
//  And the full second bank are called "MonoProgram1..n" and
//  have the bit set to "mono".
//
//  So, to effect a change to mono (each note on a channel) mode,
//  you just have to select the second bank, or for poly, the 1st.
//  Which are 0 based, so you send out a "bank change" midi miessage
//
//
//  BANK CHANGE, sent in two messages
//
//      Bx 00 yy ... x is channel, yy is bank MSB
//      Bx 20 zz ... x is channel, zz is bank LSB
//
//  PATCH CHANGE
//
//      Cx yy  ... x is channel yy is patch number
//
//  FTP
//
//      The FTP receives it's patch/bank messages on channel 1.
//      It requies that you also send a patch change
//      after you set the bank LSB.  It will respond with
//      a 25 byte "patch" name sysex.  So, skipping the MSB:
//
//      poly mode:
//
//          B0 20 00
//          C0 00 00
//
//      mono mode:
//
//          B0 20 01
//          C0 00 00
