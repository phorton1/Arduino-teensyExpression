
POLY (MONO) MODE

    poly = all strings on channel 1
    mono = each string on channel 1..6
    
    DOES NOT REQUIRE BOOTING CONTROLLER WITH UP BUTTON PRESSED
    which puts you in "hardware" mode.   The FTP accepts patch
    and bank changes when booted normally.
    
    When booted normally it comes up in hardware patch #1, which
    is PolyProgram1, which has it's poly/mono bit set to "poly".
    
    At this time the full first bank has that setting.
    And the full second bank are called "MonoProgram1..n" and
    have the bit set to "mono".
    
    So, to effect a change to mono (each note on a channel) mode,
    you just have to select the second bank, or for poly, the 1st.
    Which are 0 based, so you send out a "bank change" midi miessage
    
    
    BANK CHANGE, sent in two messages
    
        Bx 00 yy ... x is channel, yy is bank MSB
        Bx 20 zz ... x is channel, zz is bank LSB
    
    PATCH CHANGE
    
        Cx yy  ... x is channel yy is patch number
        
    FTP
    
        The FTP receives it's patch/bank messages on channel 1.
        It requies that you also send a patch change
        after you set the bank LSB.  It will respond with
        a 25 byte "patch" name sysex.  So, skipping the MSB:
        
        poly mode:
            
            B0 20 00
            C0 00 00
    
        mono mode:
        
            B0 20 01
            C0 00 00
    

SPLITS and LAYERS

    I wanna see if the controller sends out grouped messages
    according to splits, or if that's merely data used by
    an FTP program.
    
    Does not appear so.  I created a split for the bottom
    two strings on MonoProgram2, and I still get strings
    1-6 on separate channels.
