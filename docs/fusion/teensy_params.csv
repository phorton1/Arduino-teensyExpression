__________DISPLAY_________,,0


, measurements from new imported 3D model

, display_3d_wide,		mm,	83 mm,			from 3D model
, display_3d_high,		mm,	55 mm,			from 3D model
, display_3d_deep,		mm,	5.75 mm,		from 3D model
, display_3d_cd_wide,	mm,	15 mm,			from 3D model
, display_3d_cd_deep,	mm, 1.5 mm,			from 3D model
, display_3d_cd_off,	mm, 15 mm,			CD on right, display face up, offset from top from 3D model

, In my old 3D model, the display is as wide as the inside space
, but there is 0.3mm of space above and below it, giving an
, effective height of the vertical display space of 56.6 mm.

, old_display_wide,		mm,	86 mm,			from my 3D old model
, old_display_high,		mm,	56 mm,			from my 3D old model (with 0.6 mm of space left)
, old_display_deep,		mm,	7 mm,			from my 3D old model
, old_display_cd_wide,	mm,	17 mm,			from my 3D old model
, old_display_cd_deep,	mm, 2 mm,			from my 3D old model
, old_display_cd_off,	mm, 13.2,			CD on right, offset from top from my old 3D model

, The new display design closely mimicks the old one.
, In the new design, the 3D model will be inserted and adjusted
, appropriately, but we will design it for the old tolerances.

, This design carries over the width of the display mount as 92mm,
, which is called "display_space". Given a wall width of 3mm, this
, exactly fits the old_display_wide of 86mm.
,
, In the old model the top pieces fit tolerance was offset
, into the top pieces, and the tops were separated by 92.4mm.
, In our model we will offset the display_mount sides by 0.2mm,
, so the walls will really only be 2.8mm, but the tops will be
, separated by 92mm.
,
, We will also carry over the thickness of the "securing pieces" as 4mm

display_space,		mm,	92 mm,			distance between top left and top right (display mount exceeds both by 2mm)
, display_side,		mm,	3 mm,			thickness of side walls
, display_secure,		mm,	4 mm,			thickness of securing piecesi

display_wide,		mm,	86, 			from old model
display_high,		mm,	56.6 mm,		the effective height from old model
display_deep,		mm, 7 mm,			using old depth for securers
display_cd_wide,	mm,	17 mm,			using old cd dimensions for securers
display_cd_deep,	mm, 2 mm,
display_cd_off,		mm, 14 mm,			compromise, hope it still fits

, the bezels are set in from the above two display constants

bezel_thick,		mm,	1.00
bezel_bottom,		mm,	1.75
bezel_top,			mm,	1.85
bezel_left,			mm,	1.5 mm,
bezel_right,		mm,	5.0 mm,

, which leads to the following contrained values

, disp_window_wide,	mm,	79.5 mm,
, disp_window_high,	mm,	53.0 mm,
