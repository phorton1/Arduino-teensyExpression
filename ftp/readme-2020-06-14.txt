TO SPOOF FTP EDITOR USING midiOx and loopMidi

(1) Create a loopMidi device called "Fishman TriplePlay"

(2) In MidiOX, select the second (loopMidi) "Fishman TriplePlay" input
(3) select the first (orig) "Fishman TriplePlay" output
(4) In "routings" route the one to the other.

I would *think* that this is spoofing the INPUT to the controller by
providing an alternate endpoint that the FTP editor is using, YET
it "feels" like I am seeing the controller OUTPUT because, for instance,
when I turn the controller volume control, I see a series of 
CC Volume messages (sent on channels 1 and 2 in thie case)


    TIMESTAMP IN PORT STATUS DATA1 DATA2 CHAN NOTE EVENT               
    0006B87B   2  --     B0    07    6E    1  ---  CC: Volume            
    0006B87B   2  --     B1    07    6E    2  ---  CC: Volume            
    0006B8B5   2  --     B0    07    6F    1  ---  CC: Volume            
    0006B8B5   2  --     B1    07    6F    2  ---  CC: Volume            
    0006B8D2   2  --     B0    07    71    1  ---  CC: Volume
    ....
    
    Yet I DON'T see active sensing messages coming from the controller ...
    
(5) REVERSE EXPERIMENT
    select the first (orig) FTP input device
    and route it to the second (loopMidi?) output device,
    AND I SEE NOTHING
    
    Unfortunately I cannot really tell which is which.
    
(6) Note that I cannot select the "MIDIIN2 (Fishman TriplePlay)"
    OR "MIDIOUT2 (Fishman TriplePlay)" ports while the FTP editor
    is running, but when I DO select them, I start seeing 
    active sensing messages coming from the controller.
    
    That makes me think that the FTP editor is really using those
    "other" MIDIIN2 and MIDIOUT2 devices ...
    
    
(7) Just adding two loopMidi ports, I notice that they are added
    in midiOX BEFORE the existing Fishman ports ...
    
    So maybe I have it backwards
    
    SOMETHING IS FUCKING WORKING
    
    
(8) OK, I created a pair of loopMidi devices, "MIDIIN2 (Fishman TriplePlay)"
    and "MIDIOUT2 (Fishman TriplePlay)", then in MidiOX, I connect the second
    (real) MIDIIN2 to the output (loopMidi) MIDIIN2, and I connect the first
    (fake) MIDIOUT2 to the output (real) MIDIOUT2 ... although I do not "see"
    any trafic, it appears to be working.
    
    I also discovered that you can use the MidiOX "View-SysEx" window to send
    other messages to the controller ... So, when I typed the following into
    the window:
    
            b7 1f 3c
            b7 3f 01     <--- last byte is "string-value"
            
    and send it to the controller (without the FTP editor running) and then
    start the FTP editor, the value for string 1 has changed to "2" (1 based),
    where S is 0..5 for string 1..6 and V is 0..15 for sensitivity 1..16

    It appears as if "b7 1f 3c" is the "command" for set string senstivity
    to the following value, cuz when I send the "3F" message by itself,
    nothing happens.
    
    Note that I can still send these messages, and they appear to affect
    the controller, while the FTP editor is running, but it does not show
    the changes until I restart it ...
    
(9)  Trying it again with just the "Fishman TriplePlay" output device
     
     - Nada
     
     FTP editor not happy if I take over just the Fishman Triple Play
     output port, but when I remove all the loopback ports, I see it
     worked.
     
(10) Trying the loopback on the Fishman TriplePlay

    Henceforth "FTP" stands for "Fishman TriplePlay"
    
    a. create loopMidi FTP device
    b. in MidiOx, loop the fake (first) FTP to the
       second (real) output one.
       
    that worked!
    
    
(11) Trying complete spoof

    Create the "MIDIIN2 (FTP)", "MIDIOUT2 (FTP)", and "FTP" loopMidi Devices
    - connect the first (fake) MIDIOUT2 input to the second (real) MIDIOUT2 output
    - connect the second (real) MIDDIN2 input to the first (fake) MIDIIN2 output
    - connect the first (fake) FTP input to the second (real) FTP output
    - connect the second (real) FTP input to the first (fake) FTP output
     
    This creates a feedback loop of some kind where the inputs and outputs
    are always going.
    

================================================================

(12)  OK SO I FINALLY FIGURED THE SPOOF OUT

    a. Create the "MIDIIN2 (FTP)", "MIDIOUT2 (FTP)", and "FTP" loopMidi Devices
    b. connect the first (fake) MIDIOUT2 input to the second (real) MIDIOUT2 output
    c. connect the second (real) MIDDIN2 input to the first (fake) MIDIIN2 output
    d. connect the second (real) FTP input to the first (fake) FTP output
    
    This stops the endless loops, and lets me see (A) what the FTP editor
    sends to the controller, and (B) what the controller replies with.
    
    Note that MidiOx's idea of "input" and "output" monitors is not very useful
    as all message go to both windows, so you might as well only look at the
    input monitor ...
    
    
MOVING TO A DOC FILE SO THAT I CAN HAVE PICTURES ....
